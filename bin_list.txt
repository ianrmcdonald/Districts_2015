DISTRICT PAPER 2015:  BIN LIST

DATA:

1.  Population: Fix the per district New Hampshire data
2.  Population: Verify the correct number of districts per state for both chambers.

Still have not cleaned up codes.  Need to add Seante and table a list of excluded states. 

!!!!Need a Senate Gazette.!!!!

Rework the structure some more.

12/16/14:  Still significant gaps in the SM dataset. For instance, only picking up 47 of 60 OR house districts
in 2012.  Need to catalog these gaps.  How do we plug them?

del <- df.house.2000s[is.na(df.house.2000s$mrp_estimate),]
